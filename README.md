# Project Description

This project was created as part of **The Odin Project** course.

It serves as a walkthrough of various resources and guides designed to build foundational knowledge and develop projects that demonstrate mastery of software development skills. My motivation for following this course is to create a personal portfolio to showcase my professional experience while refreshing and revisiting my coding background and proficiency.
